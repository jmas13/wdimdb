# wdimdb
A simple SPA which querys omdb for movie info and uses an express backend to save favorites to a json file.

## To-do
- Lot's of clean up. The movie view was a can of worms that will require a lot of refactoring
- Style: (with the exception of the sweet logo and lovely background) styling is done with js and what is there is ugly
- Seperation of concerns: the most functions here are highly interdependent especially in views
- Changing how favorites get posted to allow for deleting favorites
- Lots and lots <sup> and lots <sup>  and lots <sup>  and lots <sup>  and lots
